# Hangman Game 
<br />
* The Game is implement Using python. 
* Used Tkinter Module to build  Attractive User-Interface  and  Random  Module to get random word from file. 
* loops   and  functions  are  helped  to  efficiently  build  this  game. 
* Text files are used for store and retrive the words and player records.

## CHALLENGING PART WHILE WORKING ON THE PROJECT 
<br />


- We faced some errors While reading the scoreboard file while the scoreboard is empty. 
- We faced a problem While inserting an underscore with space (‘_ ’). 
- We faced a problem While printing high scores if a player gets a high score. 
- We had issues when importing the xxxx.py files.
<br /><br />

## ANY NEW THING LEARNT IN PYTHON WHILE WORKING ON THE PROJECT 
<br />


- We learned to tackle with filing concept and understood some methods of filing. 
- We learned about function and how we can use one function at many times. 
- We learned about modules like random. 
- We learned about how a while loop will work inside the function. 
- We learned about how we can manipulate many conditions inside the function like while loop.
